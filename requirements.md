- The main command is 'tada', but 'td' should work too.
- The app should use the todotxt standard as specified on https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt, so a single item should be structured like this: ` x 2025-09-25 2025-09-24 Review blog post @Work pri:A` where the x marks a completed item.
- The app should store everything in a single txt file.
- The app is primarily intended to run with the command 'tada', after which it takes over that terminal window and provides an interactive, app like experience.
	- in the future, interaction through direct cli commands could be added - but not for now
- The app has the following modes, which are inspired by vim
	- normal mode: the default mode, to navigate, issue commands with leader based keymaps
	- command mode: enter commands directly
	- insert mode: add or modify a task
	- visual mode: not sure whether we need this, but add anyway
- modes can be changed to from normal mode
	- command mode: `:`
	- insert mode: `i` OR `<Enter>`
	- visual mode: `v`
	- Back to normal mode: `<Esc>`
- Please populate the app with a default example todo list
- When the app loads, the existing todo list should be displayed
- For now, the modes should not do anything, this will come later.
